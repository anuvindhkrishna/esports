     ESports turns online gaming into a spectator sport. It mimics the experience of watching a professional sporting event,
      except instead of watching a physical event, spectators watch video gamers compete against each other.</font></p>

     ESports has become a lucrative industry in recent years, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in profit. This popularity has allowed it to function much like other professional sports leagues: players are paid by the operators in exchange for their participation; the operators are paid by the distributors in exchange for the right to broadcast the games and by the audience in exchange for the right to watch. Also, as with other sports and industries, 
     eSports is prolific for the advertisers and partners that are featured alongside the games.</font></p>

     The sudden surge of Esports as a hobby and a career option happened due to cheap data availability for game downloads
     , 5G rollout, and investments coming in the gaming sector to push the industry growth.<BR>
     A report published in a FICCI-EY report revealed that the number of online gamers in India touched 65 million in 2019
      that is expected to reach 440 million by 2022. The industry has also witnessed a remarkable surge in investments by capital 
      ventures and noted investors.<BR></font></p>
